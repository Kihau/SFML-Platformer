# SFML Platformer
I'm trying to make simple SFML platformer game in C++

## Informations about program
- Works only on 64 bit version
- All sfml libs are linked statically
- It is failure and it's most likely not going to be finished ¯\\_ (ツ) _/¯

## TO DO
- [X] Fix Animation class (Update func)
- [X] Fix character displaying 
- [X] Fix warnings (?)
- [ ] Put InitResources to all_headers
- [ ] Remove IR class from Player class 
- [ ] Add jumpinng mechanics
